# Airline Mining Data Project
### This project analyzes Twitter data for six major US airlines. The main objective is to gain insights into customer sentiment and the topics discussed in the tweets. The project is divided into six parts:

## Part 1: Generate Word Cloud for All Major Airlines
### Visualize the most frequently mentioned words in the tweets related to each airline using word clouds. This will provide a quick overview of what customers are discussing in their tweets.

## Part 2: Sentiment Distribution across All Airlines
### Analyze the distribution of positive, neutral, and negative sentiment across all airlines. This will give a comparative view of customer sentiment for each airline.

## Part 3: Sentiment Classification using Logistic Regression and HuggingFace ROBERTA Model
### Implement two methods to classify airline sentiment:
### Use Logistic Regression on the processed text data. Use the HuggingFace ROBERTA Model to create a separate sentiment score and compare the performance of the two methods in classifying airline sentiment.

## Part 4: Emotion Classification
### Using a pre-trained emotion classification model (pickle file) from another project, classify the emotion of the tweets based on their text content.

## Part 5: Topic Modeling and Distribution across Airlines
### Identify the most common topics discussed in the tweets and analyze how the distribution of these topics differs across airlines. This can provide insights into specific areas where airlines excel or need improvement.

## Part 6: Sentiment Heatmap for Different Topics
### Create a heatmap that displays the sentiment associated with each airline for different topics. This can help visualize how well each airline is performing in various areas based on customer sentiment.

## Part 7: Perception Map of Airlines on Two Selected Topics
### Select two topics (dimensions) and create a perception map of how all the airlines are located on the two-dimensional map. The axes range from -1 to 1, where 1 denotes that all the tweets pertinent to an airline about that topic are positive, and -1 denotes that all tweets are negative. This can help compare airline performance in specific areas visually.
